        My name is Chris Chun. I am currently studying to become a back-end programmer.
        My goal is to create mobile apps or become a game developer. My dream has been 
        to work alongside engineers and work on robotics. I believe that machines are the 
        future and programming is a vital component in machinery. I hope that I will be able
        to tackle on projects that will bring great change to everyday life. In my free time,
        I love to play basketball, hike, and games. I go to the gym often and workout to keep
        my body healthy and fit. Sometimes, I build model kits of Gundams and customize them.
        They are a great way for me to relieve stress and I think they look awesome.
